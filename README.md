# 360VR

A small project to create and edite 360 image for VR headset with just a vocal prompt.

## Description

$${\color{red}speech -> text -> image -> 360 image building -> local data -> VR headset data -> VR display}$$  

This project seamlessly integrates several stages of data processing. It begins by transcribing spoken words into text, then transforms that text into visual representations. Further, it constructs immersive 360-degree images from these visuals. Leveraging local data sources, it enhances the experience by integrating VR headset data, allowing for a comprehensive VR display. Through this pipeline, the project offers a holistic approach to speech-to-image conversion, catering to both standard visual formats and immersive VR environments.
